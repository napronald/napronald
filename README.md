# Hi there üëã
I'm Ronald, an incoming Master's student in Data Science at UC Berkeley this fall. I recently graduated from UC Merced with a Bachelor's in Applied Math. Throughout my undergrad, I was heavily involved in machine learning research and held several leadership positions. I am currently focused on enhancing my web development skills and improving my data structures and algorithms through LeetCode.
