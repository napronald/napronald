# Hi there üëã
I'm Ronald, a recent Applied Math graduate from UC Merced, preparing to begin my master's in Data Science this fall. Throughout my academic journey, I've deeply engaged in machine learning research and taken on significant leadership roles. Beyond my academics, I'm dedicated to enhancing my programming skills through web development and data structures/algorithms.

<details>
<summary>üå± What I‚Äôm currently working on</summary>
<br>

I am currently focused on the integration of machine learning models into web applications. I am in the process of creating interactive and user-friendly web applications that leverage the power of AI to deliver impactful user experiences. On the side, I am also trying to learn more about natural language processing.
