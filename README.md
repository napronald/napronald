# Hi there üëã
I'm Ronald, a Master's student studying Data Science at UC Berkeley. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Applied Math from UC Merced. Throughout my undergrad, I was heavily involved in machine learning research and held several leadership positions. Occasionally, I try to enhance my web development skills and improve my data structures and algorithms through LeetCode.
