# Hi there üëã
I'm Ronald, a highly motivated Applied Mathematics undergraduate at UC Merced. Throughout my academic journey, I've deeply engaged in machine learning research and taken on significant leadership roles. Beyond my academics, I'm dedicated to enhancing my programming skills through self-study in web development and data structures/algorithms.

<details>
<summary>üå± What I‚Äôm currently working on</summary>
<br>

I am currently focused on deploying models on a website, learning and applying a combination of **JavaScript**, **CSS**, **HTML**, and **Flask**. I aim to integrate advanced machine learning models with web technologies, enabling interactive and user-friendly web applications that leverage the power of AI. In March, I will embark on a new project aimed at predicting interactions between drugs.
