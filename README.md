# Hi there üëã
I'm Ronald, an incoming Master's student in Data Science at UC Berkeley this fall. I recently graduated from UC Merced with a Bachelor's in Applied Math. Throughout my undergrad, I was heavily involved in machine learning research and held several leadership positions. I am currently focused on enhancing my web development skills and improving my data structures and algorithms abilities through LeetCode.

<br>

- **Undergraduate Researcher:** My research focuses on the classification of Whole Slide Images. I was supervised by [Prof. Roummel Marcia](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/rmarcia/index.html) and graduate mentor Mohammed Aburidi. My work has been accepted for publication and presentation at IEEE EMBC 24. You can view my work [Paper](https://napronald.github.io/EMBC24.pdf) |  [Code](https://github.com/napronald/GI-Cancer-MSI-CCNet-MIL)
  
- **Summer Undergraduate Researcher:** Led a team to enhance the robustness and accuracy of classification models through Generative Adversarial Networks. You can find the work I did [here](https://github.com/napronald/Synthetic-Data-Generation-for-Deep-Learning-Model-Enhancement).
- **Data Science Challenge Intern:** Designed models for diagnosing irregular heartbeats and reconstructing cardiac transmembrane potentials at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. You can find the work I did [here](https://github.com/napronald/Data-Science-Challenge-2023/blob/main/DSC_poster.pptx.pdf)
