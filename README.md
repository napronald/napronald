# Hi there üëã
I'm Ronald, an enthusiastic and dedicated undergraduate Applied Math student at UC Merced. My academic journey is highlighted by an array of relevant coursework such as Applied Statistics, Stochastic Processes, and Advanced Programming. Alongside my coursework, I've actively engaged in ML research and leadership roles. 

<details>
<summary>üå± What I‚Äôm currently working on</summary>
<br>

I am currently focused on deploying models on a website, learning and applying a combination of **JavaScript**, **CSS**, **HTML**, and **Flask**. I aim to integrate advanced machine learning models with web technologies, enabling interactive and user-friendly web applications that leverage the power of AI.
